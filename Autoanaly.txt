A tool able to read automata (NFA, DFA, etc.) from dotty [1] files and able to perform a number of analyzes. For example, it should be able to report if the input automata represent the same language, if they accept all words of a given alphabet, and if they accept only the empty string or the empty set. The tool should be also able to perform some operations with the automata, such as Cartesian product, intersection, and complement. The operations to be performed should be specified using a simple language developed during the project. The resultant automata should be output to a dotty file.
